<p>Sometimes you want to display the value of a TV that is not connected to the template of the current Resource. The ShowTv Snippet allows you to display any TV on any page, even if the TV is not connected to the current Resource in any way.

<h3>Installing ShowTv</h3>

<p>
Go to System | Package Management on the main menu in the MODX Manager and click on the "Download Extras" button. That will take you to the
Revolution Repository (AKA Web Transport Facility). Put ShowTv in the search box and press Enter. Click on the "Download" button, and
when it changes to "Downloaded," click on the "Finish" button. That should bring you back to your Package Management grid. Click on the
"Install" button next to ShowTv in the grid. The ShowTv package should now be installed.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><fixedpre>
    [[!ShowTv? &tvID=`12` &resourceID=`14` &render=`0`]]
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>The example above will show TV 12's value for Resource 14. The first two properties are required. The third is optional (it defaults to 0).</p>

<p>If <fixedpre>&render=`1`</fixedpre>, the snippet tag will be replaced by the rendered value of the TV. If not, it will be replaced by the raw value of the TV. Showing the raw value is faster and will work in most cases.</p>

<p>The name of the snippet and the properties are case-sensitive, so be careful to type them correctly or the snippet will not work.</p>
